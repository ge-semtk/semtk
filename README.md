## RACK and Docker
Check out this quick-and-easy [docker demo](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/Install-a-Docker-RACK-Box), courtesy of [the RACK project](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK).  There are a variety of installation and demo options listed in the [RACK wiki](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki)

RACK is an active opensource Verification and Validation tool being developed on the DARPA ARCOS program.   SemTK is a key piece of its architecture, and is being continuously improved to serve the RACK project.
